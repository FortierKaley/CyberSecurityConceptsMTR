            <h2>Defense in Depth</h2>
            <img src="assets/mobilePhone.jpg"></img>
            <p>A comprehensive strategy of including multiple layers of security
                within a system so that if one layer fails, another layer of security is already in place to
                stop the attack/unauthorized access. Examples:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1. A castle is secured by a moat, a drawbridge, and guards at the gate.</li>
                <li>2. Your home computer is secured by locks on the door, an alarm system, and a
                    firewall.</li>
                <li>3. Company data is secured by a firewall, passwords, and encryption.</li>
            </ol>
